BlockAttack
===========

This is a clone of CrackAttack I made in Unity3d. It is a rewrite of a previous
LUA version for the PSP Handheld. This version is fully playable in a web browser.

The goal of the game is to match similar colors creating combos. Use these to
clear the screen before it fills. The more you match the faster the game plays.

If the screen fills to the top you lose. But before you are forced to tap out
you have a few seconds to resucue yourself!
